# heptagon-AI
The project uses Filecoin's lighthouse storage (we also implemented EVM compatible onramp contracts) to store datasets. We than implemented training and proof of learning for the simple image prediction AI model made in pytorch. We trained the model and calculated proof of learning. We verified proof of learning inside Phalas TEE simulator - we used tdx_quotes to sign the valid proof and verify it on the Solidity smart contract (we mocked Automata's verifier). Finally we used Flare networks FDC to verify the contributions that the users have made (quality of the data is estimated by its variance) to the model and FTSO to calculate accurate prices of the rewards to pay. For the frontend we used Nextjs and React.
